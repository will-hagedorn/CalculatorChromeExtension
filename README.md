# CalculatorChromeExtension
A pop-up calculator chrome extension.

Created from Feb-Mar 2024. Uploaded to GitHub on 5/14/2024.

Created because I got too lazy to open a new tab when I needed to check my arithmetic, so I decided to make a pop-up extension and learn how to use React.js in the process.
